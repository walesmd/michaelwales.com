    <p><img src="//gravatar.com/avatar/533b687cf97f813c620703e41c215fd7?s=200" class="align-right">I'm Michael Wales, a Full Stack Web Developer and Open Source Advocate. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, CA, with my girlfriend (Daniele), and our three children (Zach, Tiara and Aiden). I enjoy all things technology related, from programming and web design to car audio and hobby electronics. If I'm not busy working from our amazing offices at Udacity, you'll most likely find me playing paintball, video games or catching up on my favorite TV shows and movies.</p>

    <p>I'm currently the Director of Learning, Web Education Group, for [Udacity](http://udacity.com/) where we're helping people improve their lives through affordable, engaging and effective higher education. My specific focus, at this time, is on improving the student experience, quality and number of courses we provide related to Web Development. [My resume](/resume/) is available and details this work in addition to my work as a Department of Defense contractor and my enlistment in the U.S. Air Force.</p>
